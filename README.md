travel-graph
============

simple command line python script for creating travel itineraries + finding least expensive route.

this project was motivated by the fact that while there are many websites that allow the user to
find cheap flights, I had difficulty finding anything that helps the user find cheap *itineraries*.

this is useful if you are planning a trip that includes many destinations; location-hopping if you will.

currently the user must input the flights/buses/etc manually, but the tool provides an easy way for
adding, removing, viewing every flight, and can compute the least expensive path.
