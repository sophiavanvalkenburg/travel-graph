travel-graph
============

simple command line python script for creating travel itineraries + finding least expensive route.

this is useful if you are planning a trip that includes many destinations; location-hopping if you will.

currently the user must input the flights/buses/etc manually, but the tool provides an easy way for
adding, removing, viewing every flight, and can compute the least expensive path.
