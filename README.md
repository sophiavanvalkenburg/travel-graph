travel-graph
============

simple command line python script for creating travel itineraries + finding least expensive route.

this project was motivated by the fact that while there are many websites that allow the user to
find cheap flights, I had difficulty finding anything that helps the user find cheap *itineraries*.
while many websites such as Expedia, STATravel, etc allow the user to search for multiple flights,
they require the user to specify the itinerary in advance. so this tool is useful if you are 
planning a trip that includes many destinations, but visits can have a flexible order for the sake 
of being less expensive.

currently the user must input the prices flights/buses/etc manually, but the tool provides an easy 
way for adding, removing, viewing every flight, and can compute the least expensive route.
